# GUI Seismic Inversion

## Introduction
This is an ongoing GUI interface for a geophysical modelling and inversion course, we will be using Segyio for the inversion.

## Features
So far the GUI allows to read the SEGY files, select inline, crossline or time slice, and modify the scale. Inversion is pending but can be done in the notebook.

## Installation
Run pip install -r requirements.txt 

## Usage
Just run GUI.py. You can download the .segy file using the notebook and follow the complete inversion process using it as well.

## Next steps
Add functionalities as wavelet extraction to the GUI, add random slices, add inversion to the GUI.

## Contributing
Anyone willing to contribute is welcome.
